# About
Our project is the development of a calorie counting application that allows users to identify food in images, such as food photos, and calculate the number of calories in the food. The application will use advanced computer vision and machine learning algorithms to recognize foods and estimate their calorie content. Maintaining a healthy diet is a major concern for many people, and counting calories is an essential part of this process. However, manually tracking calories can be time-consuming and error-prone, especially when eating out or preparing meals with multiple ingredients. Our calorie counting application aims to address these issues by providing a fast, accurate, and user-friendly way to calculate the calories in food..
